////WARNING, THIS IS OUT OF DATE. THE BUILDERS HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE CREATE'S DESIGN SINCE WE WRITE THIS//

//This file should be entirely comments//
//It should pass through gcc without any kind of compilation happening//
//the .c extention is just for syntax highlighting//
//PSEUDO CODE FOR CREATE MODULE//

//I assume this will be off center, so we don't place the cubes in front of botguy

//connect to create
//rotate 90^o
//make ms0 move in
//make ms1 move in (in the other direction)
//this grabs the cube
//move the big servo up, thus picking the cubes off the floor
//move wheel 0 forward
//move wheel 1 forward at the same speed as the other so that it drive in a straight line
//drive forward the correct amount so that the cubes are being held over the pieceof wood or whatever its called
//lower the big servo so that the cubes are sitting on the piece of fucking wood or whatever THE F U C K ITS CALLED
//make ms0 move out
//make ms1 move out in the other direction
//this drips the cubes
//drive backward

//WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS PART
//somehow center the army thing in front of botguy
//WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS PART

//drive forward, so as to knock botguy off
//drive back
//rotate 90^o
//drive all the way back
//drive worward, parrallell to the wood thing
//use the other arm to scrape everything into the 'caldera'
